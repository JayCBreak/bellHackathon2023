# HONEYPOT - Bell Hackathon 2023
This is Team Troubleshooter's Java PoC code for Bell's 2023 Hackathon - Geekfest!

*This project won 2nd place at Bell's Geekfest 2023 out of a total of 45 groups.*

## Challenge Prompt:

Create an innovative solution to protect sensitive data from cyber attacks and ensure data privacy

## Solution:
Our project provides users with a contained environment to detect and confuse threat actors. When attempting to use a number of common web exploits, the hacker is redirected to a decoy database. 

This helps keep real user data out of the hands of hackers while also making them think they have performed a successful hack. 

This would cause most threat actors to give up attempting more complex methods of attack which may actually exfiltrate real user data.


### Decoy Database Approach:

   - **Deception and Misdirection:** It can deceive attackers by presenting them with false information, wasting their time and resources.
   - **Threat Intelligence:** It allows you to gather intelligence on the attacker's methods and intentions, which can help strengthen security.
   - **Detection:** It acts as an early warning system, signalling that an attack is being attempted.
